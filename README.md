## Overview

**Grade Calculator** is my first hobby project using Flutter, where I've implemented a simple yet functional grade calculation application. Through this project, I've gained a solid understanding of Flutter's widget structure, variables, method creation, and application architecture.

## Features

- **Multiple Lessons Input**: You can input multiple lessons with corresponding credits and grades.
- **Automatic Average Calculation**: The app calculates the average based on the inputted data.
- **Clear UI/UX**: A simple and intuitive user interface makes it easy to navigate and use.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the app:

## How to Use

1. **Select a Lesson**: Choose a lesson from the dropdown.
2. **Set Grade and Credit**: Assign a grade and the corresponding credit.
3. **Add to the Lesson List**: Click to add the lesson to the list.
4. **View the Average**: The app will automatically calculate and display the average grade.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Widget Structures**: Understanding how to compose and structure Flutter widgets.
- **State Management**: Handling state and updating UI dynamically.
- **Method Creation**: Building methods to handle user inputs and perform calculations.
- **Application Architecture**: Organizing code effectively to create a scalable application.
